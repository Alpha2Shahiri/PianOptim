# --------- True_Pianoptim ---------

The aim of this project is to define, through numerical simulation and optimal control, new performance strategies that might help reduce exposition to risk of injuries.

The file Piano_final_version.py is a simulation of 5 chords played fortissimo with optimized movements and external forces (keys interaction).

The file Pianoptim_V1 is a simplified version of the same 5 chords but neglecting keys interaction, so without external forces.

FINAL MODEL TO DEVELOP

- The file "2__final_models_piano >> 5___final___final___squeletum_hand_finger_1_key_4_phases" gathered simulations of 1 key (principal LA of the piano)
played strucked staccato, and pressed staccato with the key interaction, for different values of torque minimisation.

- The file "2__final_models_piano >> 5___final___final___squeletum_hand_finger_1_key_4_phases >> pressed >>
3_multistart_different_minimisations >> multistart_pressed.py " is a multistart code to run mutiple simulations
with different minimisation weights at the same time. Just adapted for pressed attack for the moment.

OLD FINAL MODELS

- The file "2__final_models_piano" also gathered old final models which were steps to reach the 5_final_final_model.

OTHER DOCUMENTS

- The file "1__experimental_datas_and_calculations" gathered experimental datas taken from the lab server (access path 
detailed in "experimental_data_access_path" file. 
There are also calculations of useful dimensions.

- The file "3__two_models_of_squeletum_used" gathered two models of squeletum. In our model, the wrist and the hand come 
from the "stanford_model", and the other limbs come from the "wu_model". This file gathered also .slt files format for 
the used limbs, in order to open their mesh in a 3D software, in MeshLab for example.

- The file "4__lab_files" gathered non-important files.

- The file "a__show_bioMod.py" is to show a bioMod.

- The file "b__animate_results" is to animate the a .pckl results file, saved during a simulation.

- The file "c__CODE_EXPLAINATIONS_FILE" gathered technical explanations on codes developed, and some code advices.

- The file "d__AXIS_OF_DEVELOPMENTS" gathered axis of developments for the Pianoptim project !
