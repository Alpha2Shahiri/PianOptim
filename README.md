# --------- True_Pianoptim ---------

The aim of this project is to define, through numerical simulation and optimal control, new performance strategies that might help reduce exposition to risk of injuries.

The file Piano_final_version.py is a simulation of 5 chords played fortissimo with optimized movements and external forces (keys interaction).

The file Pianoptim_V1 is a simplified version of the same 5 chords but neglecting keys interaction, so without external forces.

--- FINAL MODEL TO DEVELOP ---

The file "2__final_models_piano >> 5___final___final___squeletum_hand_finger_1_key_4_phases" gathered simulations of 1 key (principal LA of the piano)
played strucked staccato, and pressed staccato with the key interaction, for different values of torque minimisation.

--- OLD FINAL MODELS ---

The file "2__final_models_piano" also gathered old final models which were steps to reach the 5_final_model.

--- OTHER DOCUMENTS ---

Other documents called 1_experimental_datas_and_calculations, 3_data_analysis, 4_two_models_of_squeletum,
5_files and 6_archives can help you in the development of Pianoptim.
