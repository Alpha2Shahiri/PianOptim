AXES OF DEVELOPMENTS

- Axis 1 : I stopped my intern by the development of the ""2__final_models_piano >> 1___final_model___squeletum_hand_finger_1_key_4_phases >> pressed >>
4_multistart_different_minimisations >> 2_results_analysis >> pareto_front_curve_of_one_proximal_limb_torques_d._on_distal_limbs_torques >>
plot_graph.py", done to plot a pareto front curve of proximal limbs torques depending on distal limbs torques.
The curve of the pareto front must still be displayed. And the good minimisation combinaison must still be found
to run the multistart with this combinaison.

- Axis 2 : Have a look of the proportion of torque minimisation objectives for each limbs (cf. file "d_axis_2_proportion_of_minimisation_objective".
Two limb torques can be minimize with the same weight, but the "cost" of their final minimisation can be different,
because of the different limb cost proportions.

- Axis 3 : Minimize the power of degrees of freedom, instead of the torque.

- Axis 4 : Add one or two degrees of freedom for the finger.

- Axis 5 : Add muscles to the model.
