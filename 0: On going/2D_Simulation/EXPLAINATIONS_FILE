We want to minimize TAU : PHI = min tau². In our case, we obtain a concave curve.
But, the problem is that down to the curve, we obtain multiples tangents equal to 0, so we can't find the minimum point.
To solve this, we also minimize QDOT. So, PHI = min (tau² + qdot²) to obtain a concave curve but with waves,
wich permits to find easily the minimum point of the curve.
